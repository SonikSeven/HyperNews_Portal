# About

Sitting down with a coffee and reading a newspaper is pretty much a thing of the past. Most people today read the news on their laptops or phones, so online news websites are getting very popular. Some, like The New York Times, originate from offline press, but most new websites today were originally created as purely online resources, and they all share the same basic structure. In this project, you will use Django to create an online news web application.
